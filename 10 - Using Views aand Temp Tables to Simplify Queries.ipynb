This table may consist of a single column or row, but it remains a table. A view in MySQL is essentially a query that can be utilized like a table. It can be considered as a virtual table that doesn't store data but merely holds the underlying query. Whenever a view is accessed, the query beneath it is executed, and the returned results can be treated as if they were part of an actual table.\n","\n","There are [several reasons](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/create-sql-server-views.aspx) for utilizing views. One of the primary reasons is convenience, as it allows us to avoid writing lengthy and complex query sentences repeatedly. Emphasizing the DRY programming principle (Don't Repeat Yourself), using views helps save time and minimizes the chances of making unnecessary mistakes. Thus, we can store queries as reusable database views.\n","\n","In MySQL, views are created using the `CREATE VIEW` statement. They can be created based on a single table, multiple tables, or even another view. Below is the basic [CREATE VIEW syntax](http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-views-tutorial.aspx):\n","\n","    CREATE  VIEW  view_name  AS  \n","    SELECT  column1, column2, ...  \n","    FROM  table_name  \n","    WHERE  [condition];`\n","\n","It's important to note that MySQL views are read-only. This means you cannot use `INSERT`, `DELETE`, or `UPDATE` statements to modify data in the underlying base tables through the view. Views are primarily used for simplifying complex queries and providing a more structured and organized approach to data retrieval without modifying the original data in the database."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"PO9vZaYOhx8q"},"outputs":[],"source":["%load_ext sql"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZXnsUwBzhx8r"},"source":["### Connect to the database"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"wLUvxwT_hx8r"},"outputs":[],"source":["%sql mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/training"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"19c_mLp0hx8r"},"source":["### Simplifying queries with views\n","#### Creating a View**\n","\n","In MySQL, a view is a virtual table that is derived from the result of a SELECT query or a combination of multiple queries. It allows you to save a complex or frequently used query as a named view, making it easier to access and reuse the results of that query without rewriting the entire query each time. Views provide an abstraction layer over the underlying tables, allowing you to interact with the data in a more simplified and meaningful way.\n","\n","**Syntax:**\n","\n","The basic syntax for creating a view in MySQL is as follows:\n","\n","\tCREATE  VIEW  view_name  AS  \n","\tSELECT  column1, column2, ...  \n","\tFROM  table_name  \n","\tWHERE  condition;\n","\n","**Description:**\n","\n","-   **CREATE VIEW:** The `CREATE VIEW` statement is used to create a new view.\n","    \n","-   **view_name:** This is the name of the view you want to create. The view_name should be unique within the database.\n","    \n","-   **AS:** The `AS` keyword is used to define the SELECT query that will be used to populate the view.\n","    \n","-   **SELECT column1, column2, ...:** The columns specified in the SELECT query will be the columns of the view. You can use column aliases and aggregate functions in the SELECT query.\n","    \n","-   **FROM table_name:** This part of the query specifies the underlying table(s) from which the view will be derived.\n","    \n","-   **WHERE condition:** The `WHERE` clause is optional and allows you to apply filtering conditions to the data in the view.\n","    \n","\n","**Advantages of Using Views:**\n","\n","-   **Data Abstraction:** Views provide an abstracted layer over the data, hiding the complexity of underlying queries and tables.\n","    \n","-   **Data Security:** Views can be used to restrict access to specific columns or rows, providing a more secure way to share data with users.\n","    \n","-   **Query Reusability:** Views allow complex or frequently used queries to be stored as a view, making it easy to reuse the query logic in various parts of the application.\n","    \n","-   **Performance Optimization:** Views can optimize queries by precalculating results, reducing the need for repeated calculations."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Qm3yL5Pbhx8r","outputId":"ddf5cf16-a569-4d65-a6ee-619ea2f44ca6"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["
