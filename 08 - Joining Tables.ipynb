In such cases, we frequently need to utilize joins to retrieve data from multiple tables within a single SELECT query. A join allows us to connect two tables based on a common or similar column between them.\n","\n","To merge tables in a query, we employ a JOIN ... ON statement. SQLite supports various types of joins, including:\n","\n","- INNER JOIN (also known as a simple join)\n","- LEFT OUTER JOIN (also referred to as LEFT JOIN)\n","- CROSS JOIN\n","\n","However, it's worth noting that SQLite does not support RIGHT OUTER JOIN and FULL OUTER JOIN.\n","\n","By using joins effectively, we can consolidate data from different tables, enabling more comprehensive and insightful analysis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"LsfttVmNhxFK"},"outputs":[],"source":["%load_ext sql"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"oRLiBNKYhxFL"},"source":["### Connect to the database"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"WUyZTBDNhxFL"},"outputs":[],"source":["%sql mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/training"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2bQKWl6KhxFL"},"source":["### INNER JOIN\n","\n","The INNER JOIN operation is used to combine two tables together based on a common field or set of fields. When merging tables through INNER JOIN, we ensure that records from both tables align properly. To achieve this alignment, we must specify one or more fields they have in common and perform the join based on those shared fields.\n","\n","#### Checking Common Columns\n","\n","As an illustration, let's consider the tables named rch and sub. In this example, the two tables have three common columns, namely RCH/SUB, YR, and MO. These common columns are crucial for performing the INNER JOIN operation, ensuring that the relevant data is appropriately merged and related between the two tables."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"dz8KFA5JhxFL","outputId":"02027028-64d5-4782-9ada-807ce4a7309a"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" *

columns  FROM  table1  INNER  JOIN  table2  ON  table1.column  =  table2.column;`\n","\n","For example, let's perform an inner join on the columns RCH/SUB, YR, and MO.\n","\n","**Note**: When selecting columns that are common between the tables, it's essential to specify the table name to avoid ambiguity. In case the column or table names are lengthy, aliases can be utilized to provide shorter names.\n","\n","_Explanation_:\n","\n","An inner join is a type of join that retrieves only the matching rows from both tables based on the specified condition in the ON clause. It combines rows from both tables for which the ON condition is met. The result set will only contain the rows where there is a match in both tables.\n","\n","To perform an inner join on the RCH/SUB, YR, and MO columns, you can use the following query:\n","\n","`SELECT  table1.RCH/SUB, table1.YR, table1.MO, table1.other_column, table2.columnX  FROMtable1  INNER  JOIN  table2  ON  table1.RCH/SUB  =  table2.RCH/SUB  AND  table1.YR  =  table2.YR  ANDtable1.MO  =  table2.MO;`\n","\n","In this query, we select the columns RCH/SUB, YR, and MO from table1 and combine them with other desired columns from both tables. The ON clause specifies the condition for the inner join, matching the respective columns in both tables.\n","\n","**Advantages**:\n","\n","Inner joins are useful for combining related data from multiple tables, helping to consolidate and analyze information from different sources. By performing an inner join, we can obtain a more comprehensive view of the data, ensuring that we only retrieve matching records from both tables. Using aliases for lengthy column or table names enhances readability and simplifies the SQL statement.\n","\n","Remember, inner joins are most appropriate when you only need to retrieve data that exists in both tables. If you also want to include data that doesn't have matching records in both tables, other types of joins, such as outer joins, would be more suitable."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"KOkTmzt_hxFN","outputId":"6c9ad0af-178a-4526-c27d-7934a1debbb1"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[" * mysql://root:***@localhost:3306/sql-training\n","5 rows affected.\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["<table>\n","    <thead>\n","        <tr>\n","            <th>RCH</th>\n","            <th>YR</th>\n","            <th>MO</th>\n","            <th>FLOW_INcms</th>\n","            <th>FLOW_OUTcms</th>\n","            <th>PRECIPmm</th>\n","            <th>PETmm</th>\n","        </tr>\n","    </thead>\n","    <tbody>\n","        <tr>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>1981</td>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>146.34377</td>\n","            <td>146.25249</td>\n","            <td>35.60199</td>\n","            <td>3.7207437</td>\n","        </tr>\n","        <tr>\n","            <td>2</td>\n","            <td>1981</td>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>96.22569</td>\n","            <td>96.18285</td>\n","            <td>108.60607</td>\n","            <td>3.4504077</td>\n","        </tr>\n","        <tr>\n","            <td>3</td>\n","            <td>1981</td>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>11.952719</td>\n","            <td>11.861368</td>\n","            <td>149.30836</td>\n","            <td>10.566324</td>\n","        </tr>\n","        <tr>\n","            <td>4</td>\n","            <td>1981</td>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>49.486492</td>\n","            <td>49.406513</td>\n","            <td>108.60605</td>\n","            <td>10.6749935</td>\n","        </tr>\n","        <tr>\n","            <td>5</td>\n","            <td>1981</td>\n","            <td>1</td>\n","            <td>274.0668</td>\n","            <td>272.10602</td>\n","            <td>201.31128</td>\n","            <td>27.179243</td>\n","        </tr>\n","    </tbody>\n","</table>"],"text/plain":["[(1, 1981, 1, 146.34377, 146.25249, 35.60199, 3.7207437),\n"," (2, 1981, 1, 96.22569, 96.18285, 108.60607, 3.4504077),\n"," (3, 1981, 1, 11.952719, 11.861368, 149.30836, 10.566324),\n"," (4, 1981, 1, 49.486492, 49.406513, 108.60605, 10.6749935),\n"," (5, 1981, 1, 274.0668, 272.10602, 201.31128, 27.179243)]"]},"execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["%%sql\n","SELECT RCH, rch.YR, rch.MO, FLOW_INcms, FLOW_OUTcms, PRECIPmm, PETmm\n","FROM rch INNER JOIN sub\n","ON rch.RCH = sub.SUB and rch.YR=sub.YR and rch.MO=sub.MO\n","LIMIT 5"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TPWGY0v8hxFO"},"source":["### LEFT JOIN\n","\n","The LEFT JOIN clause is another type of join used in the SELECT statement.

Joins play a crucial role in consolidating data from multiple tables, transforming scattered information into a more coherent and informative whole. By combining two or more tables, we can create a larger, more contextualized table that offers a deeper understanding of the data.\n","\n","Additionally, we learned about the usefulness of aliases, which allow us to dynamically rename column or table names during our queries. This feature enhances query readability and simplifies complex expressions, making our SQL statements more concise and easier to work with."]}],"metadata":{"anaconda-cloud":{},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
