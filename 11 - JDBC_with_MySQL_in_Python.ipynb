As SQL remains a cornerstone for data manipulation and management in relational databases, mastering it is essential for any data professional. This exercise is designed to enhance your understanding of fundamental SQL commands including INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT, using the MySQL database.\n","\n","In this session, we will be working with a Python script that connects to a MySQL database. You will learn how to insert new data into a table, update existing data, and fetch records to view the changes. These operations form the basis of day-to-day interactions with any relational database and are crucial for managing and analyzing data effectively.\n","\n","To make the most of this exercise, ensure you have the MySQL server set up and accessible. We will use the `mysql-connector-python` library, a tool that allows Python to communicate with MySQL databases. This exercise will provide a clear, step-by-step walkthrough of each SQL operation, ensuring you understand the context and execution of each statement.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f0388e7a","metadata":{"id":"f0388e7a"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Importing the necessary module from mysql.connector package to use for connecting to the MySQL database.\n","import mysql.connector\n","from mysql.connector import Error"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Define a function to create and return a database connection"],"metadata":{"id":"e40umVL9tkWt"},"id":"e40umVL9tkWt"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def create_connection(host_name, user_name, user_password, db_name):\n","    #
