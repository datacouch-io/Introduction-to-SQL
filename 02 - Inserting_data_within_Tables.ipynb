As we transition from structuring databases to populating them, you’ll learn how to use various INSERT commands to add data to the tables you've created.\n","\n","In this exercise, we'll cover a range of techniques to insert data, from simple single-row inserts to more complex multi-row inserts. You'll also get hands-on experience with inserting data using specific column targeting and handling unique data entry scenarios that require precision and attention to detail.\n","\n","Whether you're a student, a budding data analyst, or a developer looking to sharpen your SQL skills, this session will enhance your ability to manipulate and manage the content within databases effectively. By the end of this exercise, you will be equipped with the knowledge needed to not only add data to your tables but also understand the intricacies of how data insertion can impact database performance and integrity.\n","\n","Let's begin populating our databases with data and see how our tables come to life!\n","\n","#### `Please complete Lab 01 before gettign started with Lab 02`"],"metadata":{"id":"r3T7Foj8WVrT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Inserting records using `INSERT INTO`\n","\n","The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to insert new records in a table. There are two ways to insert data in a table:\n","\n","1. By SQL insert into statement\n","    1. By specifying column names\n","    2. Without specifying column names\n","2. By SQL insert into select statement\n","\n","The general syntax of the `INSERT INTO` statement is as follows:\n","\n","```\n","INSERT INTO <table> [ ( <col>[,<col>…] ) ]\n","{ DEFAULT VALUES | VALUES [ ( <expression>[,<expression>…] ) | SELECT <query> }\n","```\n","\n","- `<table>`: The name of the target table into which you want to insert data.\n","\n","- `( <col>[,<col>…] )`: An optional list of column names separated by commas, enclosed in parentheses. This part is used when you want to specify the specific columns for which you're providing values. If omitted, it is assumed that you are providing values for all columns in the table.\n","\n","- `{ DEFAULT VALUES | VALUES [ ( <expression>[,<expression>…] ) | SELECT <query> }`: The `VALUES` clause or `SELECT` statement is used to provide the data that will be inserted into the table.\n","\n","    - `DEFAULT VALUES`: This option allows you to insert a row with default values for all columns. If the table has columns with default values defined, those defaults will be used for the new row.\n","\n","    - `VALUES [ ( <expression>[,<expression>…] )`: This option is used when you want to insert specific values into the table. You provide a comma-separated list of expressions enclosed in parentheses, where each expression corresponds to a value for a column in the table. The order of the expressions must match the order of the columns specified in the `INSERT INTO` statement.\n","\n","    - `SELECT <query>`: This option allows you to insert data into the table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. The `SELECT` query should return a set of rows with columns that match the columns in the `INSERT INTO` statement. The selected data will be inserted into the table.\n","\n","Choose one of the options within the curly braces based on your requirement to insert data into the table.\n","\n","Another variation could be where you are inserting a single record or multiple records in a single `INSERT` statement.
