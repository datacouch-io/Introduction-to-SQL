This tutorial is aimed at beginners and those looking to reinforce their understanding of how databases are structured and manipulated. Whether you're a student, a professional looking to switch to a tech-oriented role, or just someone curious about database management, this exercise will equip you with the skills necessary to start shaping your own databases.\n","\n","In this session, we will explore various SQL commands, particularly focusing on the CREATE TABLE statement, which serves as the foundation for storing data in a structured way. You'll learn how to define tables with different types of fields, set constraints to ensure data integrity, and understand how these tables become the building blocks for robust database systems.\n","\n","By the end of this exercise, you will not only be able to create your own tables but also appreciate the importance of precise data structuring in facilitating effective data storage, retrieval, and management. Get ready to take your first steps into the world of databases, where a well-structured table can make a world of difference in data handling!\n","\n","## **Exploring Dataset**\n","The dataset is designed around a fictitious eCommerce company with millions of records to let a data analyst analyze multiple tables related to different aspects of a business.

The syntax has been discussed in the previous responses.\n","\n","2. **Using `CREATE TABLE LIKE` Statement** (Table Creation Based on Existing Table): This method creates a new table with the same structure as an existing table, including column names, data types, and constraints. However, it does not copy any data from the existing table.\n","\n","3. **The CTAS or `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` Statement** (Table Creation with Data): This method creates a new table and populates it with data from an existing table or the result of a query.
